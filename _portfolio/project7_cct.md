The [Coalition for Critical Technology](http://forcritical.tech) was the authoring body of the open letter [_Abolish the #TechToPrisonPipeline_](https://medium.com/@CoalitionForCriticalTechnology/abolish-the-techtoprisonpipeline-9b5b14366b16) in opposition of academia's complicity in the recent trend of carceral technology masquerading as scientific progress. Download the PDF [here](https://github.com/forcriticaltech/forcriticaltech.github.io/raw/master/assets/Abolish_the_TechToPrisonPipeline.pdf). I am a co-founding member of the CCT and co-editor of the open letter.
