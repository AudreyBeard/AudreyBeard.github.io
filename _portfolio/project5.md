[This project](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/vimwiki_link_network), designed as a tool to assist my knowledge gathering for research, leverages the vimwiki project's index-building structure to build structured knowledge graphs using NetworkX. My software reads a full vimwiki article system (starting at the index), and displays each page as a separate node in a graph, with links to other nodes as directed edges. I had not been aware of Project Xanadu at the time of development, but having learned about it since, the similarity to it is notable.
