[This project](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/aws_utils) is designed to make it easy to do file copying between AWS buckets and local machines in parallel using Python's Multiprocessing library. Using this project, a developer can upload, download, and move huge amounts of files quickly and securely within Python - no command-line usage required (beyond `awscli` setup).
