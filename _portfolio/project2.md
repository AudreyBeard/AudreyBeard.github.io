[NetSounds](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/netsounds) is a framework for sonifying convolutional neural networks. Based on the NumPy and PyTorch libraries for Python 3, this project uses customized convolutional neural networks and digital signal processing to transform what an AI system "sees" into an acoustic signal. The development required me to write custom classes for each unique network architecture, and relies heavily on broadcasting and vectorized programming on the GPU and CPU to minimize latency.
