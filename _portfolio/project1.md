NetDev is a deep neural network training framework that eliminates excessive amounts of boilerplate code (like epoch looping, gradient updating, and data loader), and provides rich functionality (like logging, custom training and validation cycles, graphing, checkpointing, etc.). It is built around PyTorch, Tensorboard, tqdm, and NumPy for Python 3.
