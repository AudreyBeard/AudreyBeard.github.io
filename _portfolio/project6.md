[PlottingTools](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/plottingtools) is a Python 3 wrapper for MatPlotLib, and is designed to make common graphs easy to plot with as few lines as possible. It grew out of my desire to explore data quickly without relying on heavier data structures like Pandas DataFrames, and without reduplicating code. It is available on the Python Package Index as `pip install plottingtools` and enjoys intermittent updates.
