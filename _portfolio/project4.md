[Tensorface](https://github.com/AudreyBeard/tensorface) is a set of tools for interacting with Tensorboard log files. Since the log files are designed for reading by the Tensorboard server, they are somewhat clumsy to work with. This project uses custom Python classes to expose the data encoded within a log file as native Python data structures, like dictionaries and lists.
